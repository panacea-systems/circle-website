						They will have the responsibility of taking in the payment signals and encapsulating those
						within Circle©'s proprietary protocols and any security layers required, and dispatch it to

						messages from the Message Queue and understand which part goes where, and add any 
						additional encapsulation just as the Node dispatcher does.

						A phantom layer that resides everywhere, it deserved a separate layer of its own because
						it will reside in the end-points of all submodules and will be responsible for defining the 
						protocols of communications and security layers etc.This part will have its own, very 
						thorough documentation and immense test case since this will facilitate all sorts of inter-
						subsystem and inter-system communications.

					Upon restart, the Circle© device searches for a data connection, which can be either 
					a Wi-Fi signal, a GSM connection or even an Ethernet cable connection. Prior to the 
					establishment of the internet connection, the device jump starts and immediately prompts 
					a user authentication request. The user credentials are transferred to Panacea’s premises 
					for CDN authentication and the device allows user login only when the authentication is 
					complete. This process prevents unauthorized login and provides extra security to users by
