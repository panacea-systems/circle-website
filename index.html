						computer.The Cube is equipped with USB ports, HDMI ports and even a 3.5mm jack so 
						that any peripherals can be attached to it. It can support any models of printers, Barcode 
						scanners etc. as long as a driver is installed to it.

					<h2>Soft Layer Components of Circle©</h2>

						Paypoint Software and an unmitigated integration with all payment processors, 
						integrators and gateways. The soft layer and the hardware components will complement 
						each other and the totality of the two layers will produce Circle© as a whole.

					<h4><b>The Node</b></h4>
					<p>
						They will have the responsibility of taking in the payment signals and encapsulating those
						within Circle©'s proprietary protocols and any security layers required, and dispatch it to 
						the integrators. Each processors (i.e. Banks) will be identified by its unique ID, and they will have a special place in the integrator end (which will be discussed later).

					<br>
					<h4><b>The Integrator</b></h4>
					<p>
						This layer is where the main processing takes place. This is essentially a middleware
						that resides in the data center. The Integrator Dispatcher's main job is to take a batch of 
						messages from the Message Queue and understand which part goes where, and add any 
						additional encapsulation just as the Node dispatcher does.

					<br>
					<h4><b>The API Layer</b></h4>
					<p>
						A phantom layer that resides everywhere, it deserved a separate layer of its own because
						it will reside in the end-points of all submodules and will be responsible for defining the 
						protocols of communications and security layers etc.This part will have its own, very 
						thorough documentation and immense test case since this will facilitate all sorts of inter-
						subsystem and inter-system communications.

				<h1>Authentication & Authorization:</h1>
				<hr>
				<p>
					Upon restart, the Circle© device searches for a data connection, which can be either 
					a Wi-Fi signal, a GSM connection or even an Ethernet cable connection. Prior to the 
					establishment of the internet connection, the device jump starts and immediately prompts 
					a user authentication request. The user credentials are transferred to Panacea’s premises 
					for CDN authentication and the device allows user login only when the authentication is 
					complete. This process prevents unauthorized login and provides extra security to users by 
					prevent data theft or data tampering.
